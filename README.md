## Question:
__write__ a program to ask the user to enter a year.
Then tell her if the year is a leap year?
(leap year:a year, occurring once every four years,
which has 366 days including 29 February as an intercalary day.
If year is divisible by 4 but not by 100
Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year,
except for years that are exactly divisible by 100,
but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400)
